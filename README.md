I don’t just build models; I engineer systems that work in the real world. My expertise covers the full project lifecycle—from ideation and requirements development to material science and manufacturing process selection. I am not a hands-off theorist. I am a hands-on engineer who understands that a perfect CAD model is only the beginning. Below is a selection of projects—ranging from precision robotics to massive steel structures—that demonstrate my commitment to engineering excellence and practical, physical results.

## CAD Modeling Exercise - Patent 17,531 Wrench

Imported a pdf of patent 17,531 invented by Edward J. Worcester, dated June 9, 1857 from https://patents.google.com/patent/US17531A/en?oq=17531, scaled the image based on an overall length of 8" and then created the parts, assembly and animation in SolidWorks.

## Industrial Systems Design & Structural Analysis

Led the end-to-end technical development for the Holcim facility upgrades, including P&ID, equipment sizing, and comprehensive structural design. I performed all primary structural analyses and load calculations, subsequently developing the corresponding detailed fabrication drawings in AutoCAD. All designs and calculations were formally reviewed and approved by a Licensed Professional Engineer (PE) prior to installation. I remained onsite to serve as the lead technical liaison, ensuring that field execution strictly adhered to the approved engineering specifications.
