I don’t just build models; I engineer systems that work in the real world. My expertise covers the full project lifecycle—from ideation and requirements development to material science and manufacturing process selection. I am not a hands-off theorist. I am a hands-on engineer who understands that a perfect CAD model is only the beginning. Below is a selection of projects—ranging from precision robotics to massive steel structures—that demonstrate my commitment to engineering excellence and practical, physical results.
